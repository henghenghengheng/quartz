	- Includes use of the banjo 
	- Opening movement in sonata form with a 1st theme in twelve-bar blues structure (00:28) and a 2nd theme that suggests a spiritual (02:23)
	- Also features other influences from African-American traditions, e.g. call and response, syncopation, varied repetition of short melodic or rhythmic ideas, jazz harmonies, dialogue between different groups of instruments that remind of jazz arrangement, and instrumental timbres common in jazz (e.g. trumpets and trombones played with Harmon mutes)
