[[ECLECTICISM; synthesis of musical styles & genres]] — 
- Barber’s unique eclecticism might show influence of European Romanticism ([[EUROPEAN LINK]]), but he was not seeking to replicate it but to develop his own style
- For instance, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3RYSDsfsSY - the finale (mvt 3) has use of dissonance and syncopated rhythms displaying some influence of Stravinsky
